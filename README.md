#Introduction
The world is grappling with an invisible, deadly enemy, trying to understand how to live with the threat posed by the coronavirus. 
For some writers, the only way forward is to put pen to paper, trying to conceptualize and document what it feels like to continue living as countries are under lockdown and regular life seems to have ground to a halt.
“A picture is worth a thousand words“
As the quote speaks, Data visualization helps to derive information insights from data sources in a better way. 
so through this article, I want to showcase how one can visualize a map of their own country  affected by this dreadful virus.

We need latitude and longitude coordinates of all the Indian states, we can scrap this data from my repository (https://github.com/itsnivas-k/indian-states-coordinates/blob/main/indian%20states.geojson) 
We need the current status of coronavirus in the various states of the country, we can scrap this from my respositories
