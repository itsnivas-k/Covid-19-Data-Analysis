# Covid-19-Data-Analysis

# Introduction
The world is grappling with an invisible, deadly enemy, trying to understand how to live with the threat posed by the coronavirus. 
For some writers, the only way forward is to put pen to paper, trying to conceptualize and document what it feels like to continue living as countries are under lockdown and regular life seems to have ground to a halt.
